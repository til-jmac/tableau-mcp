# Getting Started

## Quick Start

Requirements

- Node.js 22.7.5 or newer
- An MCP client e.g. Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, etc.

This standard config works in most MCP clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tableau": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tableau/mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SERVER": "https://my-tableau-server.com",
        "SITE_NAME": "my_site",
        "PAT_NAME": "my_pat",
        "PAT_VALUE": "pat_value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Node.js Single Executable Applications

Node.js [Single Executable Applications](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html)
(SEA) are a way to package a Node.js application into a single executable file.

This provides a simple method for administrators to deploy Tableau MCP to their users without having
to install Node.js or any other dependencies. Tableau MCP is available as a SEA for both Windows and
Linux.

### Windows

Run [Manage-Server.ps1](https://github.com/tableau/tableau-mcp/blob/main/scripts/Manage-Server.ps1).

This PowerShell script can help you:

1. Download the single executable application for any of the latest releases.
2. Create a `.env` file with your Tableau MCP settings.
3. Start the MCP server.
4. Check the status of the MCP server.
5. Upgrade the MCP server.
6. Stop the MCP server.

:::warning

- Never run scripts from untrusted sources.
- Verify that the URL of the script correctly points to the main branch of the official Tableau MCP
  repository (https://github.com/tableau/tableau-mcp) and not some fork.
- Consider downloading the script first and inspecting it before running it, confirming that it is
  the correct script and not malicious.

:::

Run the script directly from the command line:

```powershell
iex (iwr -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tableau/tableau-mcp/refs/heads/main/scripts/Manage-Server.ps1").Content
```

Or, download the script first:

```powershell
iwr -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tableau/tableau-mcp/refs/heads/main/scripts/Manage-Server.ps1" -OutFile "Manage-Server.ps1"
```

:::info

- `iex` is short for
  [`Invoke-Expression`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.5)
  and executes the contents of the script.
- `iwr` is short for
  [`Invoke-WebRequest`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-7.5)
  and downloads the script from the URL.

:::

### Linux or Manual Windows Installation

1. Go to the latest [Tableau MCP release][releases] on GitHub
2. Under Assets, download the `tableau-mcp.zip` (Windows) or `tableau-mcp.tar.gz` (Linux) archive
   for your operating system.
   - If no archives exist, the release is too old and you'll need to choose a newer release.
3. Extract the archive
4. Create a [.env](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/security/env.html) file with your Tableau MCP
   settings. See [Environment Variables](./configuration/mcp-config/env-vars.md) section for more
   details.
5. Run the application

## Claude Desktop Extension

Claude Desktop users can also install Tableau MCP as a [Desktop Extension][mcpb]. This is a single
file which can be downloaded and installed without the need to edit any JSON config files.

1. Go to the latest [Tableau MCP release][releases] on GitHub
2. Under Assets, download the `.mcpb` file
3. Have your Tableau MCP settings ready (SERVER, SITE_NAME, etc) ready and follow the [Claude
   Desktop instructions][claude]

The Desktop Extension has been available starting with Tableau MCP v1.5.2.
